/**
 * Servers
 * One serve, handling many request from clients
 * - A server's job is to handle a  request form some sor of client (browsser, mobile app, another server, etc)
 * - Without considering scaling, one server instance will handle many client request. Compared to a client app where that code only cared about itself on the host machine
 * - Nodejs has built in and community packages for build all types of serverrs (API, static, realtime. etc)
